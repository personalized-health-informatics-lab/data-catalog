##
## This is a sample parameters.yml file. Your installation will need at
## least these parameters. Use this file to customize your installation
## and tell Symfony about your database and Solr servers.
##
## This file must be copied into the ./dev/ and ./prod/ directories:
## ./dev/parameters.yml will have your Dev database and Solr installation
## ./prod/parameters.yml will have the production info
##
## If you use git/github, MAKE SURE ALL THESE FILES ARE IN YOUR .GITIGNORE!!!
## You should see the line "app/config/**/parameters.yml" in there by default.
